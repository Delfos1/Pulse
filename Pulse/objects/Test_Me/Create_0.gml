// Welcome to Pulse!
// Create a new pulse emitter by typing new part_pulse_emitter
// You can supply 3 arguments: particle system, particle type and emitter size
// If you don't supply any, Pulse will create them for you.

// You can also provide a string. Pulse will create the new particle/system and assign it your given name.
// If you have already created them with those names, it will re use the existing ones

// Particle/System ID s get allocated in global.pulse._systems and global.pulse.part_types respectively.
// If unnamed they get a default name assigned. You can change default values in the Dafault_config script.
// They can be accessed by their array number.

// Pulse particles store (almost) all properties that a regular particle may have
// You can access the actual particle_type ID by accessing ._ind
// Using the pulse methods to change properties also saves these properties within the struct
// You can change the properties by using the default GM particle functions and 
// use Pulse's method .reset() to bring it back to the stored properties.

/* Pulse emitters also have properties and methods of their own, somewhat mimmicking and expanding on GM emitters
 Properties :	ANGLE (start and end, by default 0 and 360)
				RADIUS (inner and outer)
				SHAPE : A shape is an Animation Curve that is used to determine minimum and maximum length.
						Can be assigned with the methods	 .shape(AnimationCurve,"AnimationChannel")
															.tween_shape(shapeA,ChannelA,shapeB,ChannelB,tweenvalue)
						Shapes are applied over the whole circumference regardless of your angles.
						Shapes can be tweened from A to B or you can use A for the inner radius and B for the outer Radius for different effects
				TRANSFORM : .transform(scalex,scaley,rotation)
				SPEED_START : Speed is used by Pulse to calculate how far a particle travels, and its adjusted per each particle
								to keep them within your chosen limits. Pulse doesn't work with any kind of acceleration yet.
				EMITTER MODE: There are 4 modes :
									OUTWARD : Particles are created within radius and directed away from origin
									INWARD	: Particles are directed towards the origin. They stop at the origin
									SHAPE_FROM_POINT : Particles are created anywhere within radius from the origin point and directed away from origin. They remain inside the shape
									SHAPE_FROM_POINT : Particles are created anywhere within the inner and outer radius, following their shape, and directed away from origin. They remain inside the shape
							  They can be set by the methods: .inward() and .outward_shape()
				DISTRIBUTION MODE: Determines distribution along the radius. can be RANDOM, GAUSSIAN, A_TO_B (using shapes A and B for inner and outer radius) or NONE (Evenly distributed)
				DIRECTION MODE: Determines distribution along the angle range. can be RANDOM, GAUSSIAN or NONE (Evenly distributed)
